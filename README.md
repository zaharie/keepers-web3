This project, created by Zaharie Cont Neto, was built using Next.js and bootstrapped with create-next-app.

Overview
While this project demonstrates the integration of Web3 within a Next.js application, it's essential to address that the expectations set by the challenge were disproportionate. Web3 integrations are notoriously complex due to limited and fragmented documentation, and additional obstacles arose from outdated requirements in the challenge itself. Specifically, the task required using the Mumbai network, which has since been deprecated, making some instructions ineffective and adding substantial roadblocks to the integration process.
